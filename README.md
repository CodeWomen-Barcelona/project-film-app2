## Code for the full version of the React film app project

This is a private repo because we want our students to write the code themselves as much as possible. Only the coaches have access to private repos in this GitHub organisation.

The code in this repo is an example solution. Suggestions are always welcome (henriette@migracode.org). There is also a separate repo for the basic version of the React film app project. The version in this repo is more challenging for the students.
